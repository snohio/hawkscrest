# Hurricane Milton Preparedness & Updates

## Residents of Hawk's Crest

> With Hurricane Milton steadily approaching, please take this time to be sure your home is prepared. This will include securing your trash cans and clearing your patios.  If you have not already done so, please take the time to go over the Hurricane information below.

1. All outdoor furniture, play equipment, trash containers, plants not in the ground, and other items outside your home should be brought inside the garage, inside the home, or secured properly outside so that they can withstand potential high winds.
2. Purchase in advance, flashlights and batteries, bottled water; ice and non-perishable items, such as canned food, packaged food, paper and personal products, and a manual can opener.
3. Do not leave pets unattended at the property.  There are many shelters and kennels that will board your pet in case of evacuation.
4. Automatic Teller Machines (ATM’s) may not be working in case of power outage.   You’ll want to make arrangements for cash needs.
5. Charge all of your phones and electronics. In the event of power failure, turn off all appliances and keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed.   (Food will stay cool for 24 hours.)
6. Fill your vehicles gas tank before storm arrives.
7. If out of the neighborhood, avoid downed power lines and report them to your local electric company as soon as possible. (Duke Energy).
Take refuge in a small interior room during the storm away from windows.
8. Keep all windows and doors closed through the storm.  Do not crack a window or door during the storm.  Draw your verticals and drapery materials over the windows to protect from the possibility of shattering glass. You may tape your windows. Any boarding up of windows on the exterior cannot be attached to the building wall and must be attached to the window frame itself. Any tape, boards or window covers must be removed as soon as the storm passes.

## The Hawk’s Crest at Winter Park Homeowners’ Association has begun preparations of the Common Areas

1. As part of their protocol, Envera will be opening the gates/ removing barrier arms for the duration of the storm.
2. Seminole County will be turning off all streetlights as a preventative measure.
3. Additionally, ULS as well as Down To Earth will be turning off irrigation water lines to prevent flooding in the event of damage.
4. The Pool Furniture, tables, umbrellas, and chairs will be stacked up and secured at the clubhouse. Please note that furniture will be unstacked once the storm has passed and any debris at the pool cabana has been cleared.
5. All Events and/ or Meetings scheduled through Wednesday have since been cancelled due to the inclement weather.
6. Our team will return, contingent upon the storm’s speed, in order to assess the property and reset the facilities.
