# Hurricane Milton Preparedness & Updates

## Residents of Hawk's Crest

> With Hurricane Milton steadily approaching, please take this time to be sure your home is prepared. This will include securing your trash cans and clearing your patios and removing any Halloween decorations and inflatables.  If you have not already done so, please take the time to go over the Hurricane information below.

1. All outdoor furniture, play equipment, trash containers, plants not in the ground, and other items outside your home should be brought inside the garage, inside the home, or secured properly outside so that they can withstand potential high winds.
2. Being the season of Halloween, please be sure to remove all inflatables and any other decorations.
3. Be prepared with flashlights and batteries, bottled water, ice, and non-perishable items such as canned food, packaged food, paper and personal products, and a manual can opener.
4. Do not leave pets unattended at the property. There are many shelters and kennels that will board your pet in case of evacuation.
5. Charge all of your phones and electronics. In the event of power failure, turn off all appliances and keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed. (Food will stay cool for 24 hours.)
6. Fill your vehicles gas tank before storm arrives as well as Propane tanks if you have a grill.
7. ATM's and Credit Card systems may not be working in case of power outage. You’ll want to make arrangements for cash needs.
8. When you leave the neighborhood, avoid downed power lines and report them to your local electric company as soon as possible.
9. Take refuge in a small interior room during the storm away from windows.
10. Keep all windows and doors closed throughout the storm. Do not crack a window or door. Draw your drapery and vertical blinds over the windows to protect from potential shattering glass. You may tape your windows, but boarding up windows on the exterior should only attach to the window frame itself. Remove any tape, boards, or window covers as soon as the storm passes.

## From Our Own Neighborhood, WESH 2 Meteorologist - Eric Burris

Hello neighbors!

As I write this, I'm in continuous coverage talking about the storm... and want to make sure MY community also has every bit of information possible.

Hurricanes are often thought of as coastal only events. I can assure you- they are not. Just look at what Hurricane Helene did mere days ago in the Carolinas.

Looking back through time, the highest wind gusts from a hurricane felt in the Central Florida area took place from Charley back in 2004. I remember the months and months of blue roofs.

The model data for now is showing this being AS strong as that- or perhaps even stronger in our area.

This means that we need to do what we can to help each other. Bring in things that could go airborne in winds, and be ready to lock down. For now, we're looking at late morning Wednesday to 'lock down'. After that, things will get rougher and rougher.

We have been through hurricanes before, we'll make it through this- but know each system is different. This will bring different threats than we've seen, so please don't rest on laurels from the past.

Don't freak out, stay safe, and you'll be just fine.
