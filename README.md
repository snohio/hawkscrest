# Hawks Crest HOA Notes

> Notes and other public things for Hawk's Crest HOA

This is mostly for Mike Butler - HOA VP but anyone is welcome to view and access these notes.

I'm debating having this as a Github Pages just because maybe that is too public? Anyway, let me know if there are issues or concerns about this repo.

## Some Thoughts

I feel like the previous board did an **amazing** job of detangling the mess that was left from Meritage. The amount of work doing the needful effort impacted the ability to establish and work on what I would call the "fun stuff".

In the next two years, I would personally like to make an effort of firmly establishing committees, gatherings and other social events to bring this community together.

Looking through all of the emails, I feel a good bit of the maintenance items could be handled "in house", meaning if we had a GC on hand four hours a day, two days a week - a lot of the little things could be handled more efficiently and cost effective. Such things like:

- Fountains working and timing
- Tiles repaired
- Signed re-stuck and facade falling
- Basic picking up of trash
- Monitoring systems working
- Minor gate repair
- Sprinkler repair (or at least identification)

These are a lot of things being somewhat handy that I would just do myself. I'd be curious to add this to our RFP for a management company.

Solicitors. Instead of stating that Solicitors Not Welcome, can we state that Solicitors must register with the office? Then when they get to the office (not that they will go,) we can have a policy that the HOA Board must approve all solicitation. Then when someone does stop at our houses, we can just ask them to show their solicitation papers that they got from the office and point them to that direction.
