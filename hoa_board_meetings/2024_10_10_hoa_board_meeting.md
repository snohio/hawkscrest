Will need find new members under the new.

### Landscaping Committee Update

### Social Committee

* Discussed upcoming movie night

* Need simple wording on what the sponsor gets and what the committee gets. This needs to be in the form of an agreement / contract. The funds would have to be paid to the HOA and earmarked for SaCC.
* Board Members would need to be on board to approve. Eventually we can let the SaCC do this without.
* Board is open to external sponsors.
* Some things that we will likely not approve are not in alignment with the values of the community.
  
* How do we want to do approvals?
  * Email and discuss and potentially voting.
  * We can use a poll and capture the results and document that in email.

> Motion to approve the Board review of sponsorship opportunities for the Social and Communications Committee pending the creating of a basic agreement by our law firm to be used with the sponsors. The SaCC committee will need to draft the communication to the community about making sponsorships available for the board to approve via email and management to distribute.
